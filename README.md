# funLang
A statically typed programming language implemented with LLVM's C++ API designed as the next step once you've completed the Kaleidoscope tutorial. 

FunLang is parsed using a recursive-descent parser. Hopefully it provides you with enough of a base to expand upon as you learn more about LLVM. 

Rest of the stuff to come lol
