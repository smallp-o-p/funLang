# funLang
A statically typed programming language implemented with the LLVM ecosystem created for fun.

FunLang is implemented in C++17 and heavily depends on LLVM libraries. CodeGen is handled entirely by LLVM and there is heavy use of its ADT and Suport libraries. 

Rest of the stuff to come lol
# Scope of The Project 

To keep this language simple and easy enough to follow, the set of features will be basic, imagine C with some creature-comforts that I really like picked from other languages like Rust and Zig.

## Features (to implement)‚ùó

- Strong type system
  - Error return types for error handling
  - No implicit type promotions
- Operations
  - All the basic ones you expect, arithmetic, comparisons
- Data Types
  - Primitives: i32, i64, f32, f64, char, string and arrays
  - Pointers
  - Construct your own data types with *structs*
  - Sum type with enums (Pattern matching with *match* expressions)
  - A basic trait system
- Control Flow
  - *If-else* statements
  - *For*, *while*, *infinite* loops

## Examples

soon (tm)
