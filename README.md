# funLang
A statically typed programming language implemented with
LLVM's C++ API designed as the next step once you've completed the Kaleidoscope tutorial.

FunLang is parsed using a recursive-descent parser.
Hopefully it provides you with enough of a base to expand upon as you learn more about LLVM.

Rest of the stuff to come lol
# Scope of The Project 

To keep this language simple and easy enough to follow, the set of features
will be somewhat limited, however I do expect it to be Turing Complete,
you're free to add more as you wish.
## Features‚ùó

<ul>
  <li> Typed variable declarations and use of those variables </li>
    <ul>
      <li> Maybe type casting </li>
    </ul>
  <li> Basic Operations
      <ul> Comparisons </ul>
      <ul> Arithmetic </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Control Flow
    <ul> If statements</ul>
    <ul> For/While loops</ul>
  </li>
</ul>
